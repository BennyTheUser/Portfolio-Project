                    <h2>Open Entry-Level Positions</h2>
                    <p>For this assignment, our class had to look for three open entry-level positions at workplaces and see which one of the three positions we would like to choose first. I chose the entry-level positions I wanted because I would think they would earn me a good salary while doing something I can tolerate. I chose this sample because I feel this may be important later on in my life for when I graduate from high school.</p>

                    <p>This is a prototype of a web game a partner and I came up with called Coin Party. The prototype of this web game was made for a web game project my class was assigned to us because this was assigned for us to demonstrate our ability to create websites. While this prototype looks much more different compared to our final game, this prototype shows our ability to come up with possible ideas.</p>
