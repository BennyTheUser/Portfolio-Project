        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Aaron Xiong. I am a student at Clovis East High School and I am a student at the Center for Research Advanced Technology of CART for short. Ever since my elementary years, I have always liked using computers and it has only been during 11th grade where I would learn how apps and websites on the web were created. 12th grade is where I would see more about how websites are created. Since then I have learned the different programs and programming languages used to code the websites I use on the web.</p>
